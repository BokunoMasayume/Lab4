Discovering visual knowledge from weakly labeled data is crucial to scale up computer vision recognition sys- tem, since it is expensive to obtain fully labeled data for a large number of concept categories. In this paper, we propose ConceptLearner, which is a scalable approach to discover visual concepts from weakly labeled image collec- tions. Thousands of visual concept detectors are learned automatically, without human in the loop for additional an- notation. We show that these learned detectors could be applied to recognize concepts at image-level and to detect concepts at image region-level accurately. Under domain- specific supervision, we further evaluate the learned con- cepts for scene recognition on SUN database and for ob- ject detection on Pascal VOC 2007. ConceptLearner shows promising performance compared to fully supervised and weakly supervised methods.
